            <h1>The Science of Sustainability</h1>
            <p>Moving from "Less Bad" to "Truly Regenerative"</p>

            <h2>The Myth of Recyclability</h2>
            <p>For decades, the sustainability conversation was dominated by the three R’s: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. However, modern environmental science suggests that recycling—as it currently exists—is often a "band-aid" solution for a deeper design flaw. Most plastics are not truly recycled; they are 'down-cycled' into lower-quality materials until they eventually become waste. At EcoMart, our sustainability framework is built on the <strong>Circular Economy</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Material Deep Dive: Moso Bamboo</h2>
            <p>Why bamboo? It is the fastest-growing plant on Earth. Unlike timber, which takes decades to mature, bamboo can be harvested every 3–5 years. It acts as a massive carbon sink, releasing 35% more oxygen than equivalent stands of trees. In our manufacturing process, we utilize heat-press technology to create durable handles for brushes and utensils without the need for toxic glues or formaldehyde. This is the intersection of nature and engineering.</p>

            <h2>Cradle-to-Cradle Design</h2>
            <p>We analyze every product through the Cradle-to-Cradle lens. This means asking: "What happens to this product in 100 years?" If the answer is "it sits in a landfill," we don't sell it. Our goal is biological technical nutrients—materials that can safely return to the soil to grow more bamboo, or technical nutrients that can be infinitely reprocessed into new high-quality products.</p>
