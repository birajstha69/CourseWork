            <p align="center">The objective of this research is to benchmark the current product page agains industry leading
                e-commerce websites(Amazon,Etsy and Patagonia)
                .By analyzing these competitors, the goal is to identify standard feature, design trends, and
                technological best practices that are currently missing from the project
                in order to define a clear roadmap for improvement.

        <h2 align="center">Key Findings</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visual Design:</strong> Ranges from Amazon's clean/minimalist utility to Etsy's vibrant/masonry
                layout and Patagonia's
                sophisticated lifestyle storytelling.</li>
            <li><strong>User Interface(UI):</strong> All three prioritize intuitive navigation, but distinct approaches
                are used
                (prominent search for Amazon vs. minimalist layout for Patagonia).</li>
            <li><strong>User Experience(UX):</strong> Amazon focuses on speed/efficiency (one-click); Etsy on
                community/engagement;
                Patagonia on product quality/sustainability information.</li>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Utilization of AI recommendations, progressive web apps, lazy loading, and
                sustainable web
                design practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation & Features:</strong> Analysis of mega-menus, filtering options, wishlist
                functionality, and specialized
                content (like repair guides or seller messaging).</li>

            <h2 align="center">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Our product page has a solid foundation with semantic HTML and clear layout. However, it lacks modern
                e-commerce features like
                filtering,multiple images, and accessibility features. Reference sites implement responsive design,
                advanced filtering, customer
                reviews, and comprehensive accessibility support. Key improvements needed: mobile responsiveness,
                filtering/sorting, search functionality
                , multiple product images, and better accessibility.
